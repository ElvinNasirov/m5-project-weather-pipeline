# ClimaFit AI

## Team: The Outliers 

## Tourism Weather Risk & Activity Suitability

### Project Overview

This project provides data-driven weather insights to support tourism planning and decision-making. It helps travel agencies and tour operators evaluate the feasibility of outdoor activities based on both historical patterns and forecasted conditions.

The main objectives are:
- Minimize cancellation risks for tour operators  
- Enhance customer satisfaction by recommending optimal dates for specific activities  
- Provide AI-driven explanations for weather-based travel recommendations  

---
### Data Sources
We use the Open-Meteo API:

- Historical data:
https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive

- Forecast data:
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast

Parameters:
- latitude, longitude
- start_date, end_date
- daily weather variables

### Team & Responsibilities

- **Jala (Data Engineer):** Ingestion pipeline, DuckDB management, and automation  
- **Roya (Team Manager & Data Quality):** Task coordination, data validation, and cleaning logic  
- **Sema (Data Analyst):** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and tourism insights  
- **Elvin (ML Engineer):** Feature engineering, model training, and AI suitability logic

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Dataset History Length  
We use **5+ years of historical daily weather data (2021 up to the most recent available date)** to capture long-term seasonal patterns and climate variability across Azerbaijan.

#### 2. Dataset Granularity  
The data is processed at a **daily granularity**, where each record represents a 24-hour summary of weather conditions for a specific city.

#### 3. Prediction Horizon  
The project targets **medium-range forecasting (up to 28 days)**, aligning with tourism planning and booking cycles.

## Targets

We use a **multi-output regression model** to predict key weather variables required for activity suitability decisions.

- **temperature_2m_max**  
  Predicts peak daily temperature, which is critical for outdoor comfort and heat-related constraints.

- **precipitation_sum**  
  Measures total daily rainfall, the most important factor for determining whether outdoor activities are feasible.

- **wind_speed_10m_max**  
  Captures maximum wind conditions, essential for safety-sensitive activities such as cable car and boating.

- **relative_humidity_2m_mean**  
  Represents average humidity, which affects perceived temperature and overall comfort.

- **cloud_cover_mean**  
  Indicates sky conditions and visibility, useful for assessing atmosphere (e.g., sunny vs gloomy) and fog likelihood.

## Features

### Core & Derived Weather Features

- **apparent_temperature_max**  
  Represents perceived temperature (“feels like”), providing additional context for human comfort.

- **sunshine_duration**  
  Reflects how sunny a day is, providing additional context for outdoor activity quality and user experience.

- **city (encoded)**  
  Captures location-specific climate patterns across regions (Baku, Lankaran, Guba, Gabala, Shaki).

---

### Calendar Features

- **month**  
  Helps the model capture seasonal patterns within the May–June period.

- **day_of_month**  
  Provides finer time progression within each month, allowing the model to learn gradual weather changes.

---

### Lag Features (Previous Day Signals)

- **temperature_lag_1**  
  Yesterday’s temperature, used to model short-term continuity in temperature trends.

- **precipitation_lag_1**  
  Previous day’s rainfall, helping capture ongoing rain patterns.

- **wind_lag_1**  
  Yesterday’s wind speed, useful for modeling wind persistence.

- **humidity_lag_1**  
  Previous day’s humidity, supporting short-term atmospheric continuity.

---

### Rolling Features (Short-Term Trends)

- **temperature_3d_avg**  
  3-day average temperature, capturing recent warming or cooling trends.

- **precipitation_7d_sum**  
  Total rainfall over the past 7 days, indicating prolonged wet conditions.

- **wind_3d_avg**  
  3-day average wind speed, smoothing short-term fluctuations.

- **humidity_7d_avg**  
  7-day average humidity, reflecting persistent atmospheric conditions.

## Model Approach

We use historical data for model training and evaluation, applying a time-based split to ensure realistic performance assessment.

Additionally, we integrate **7-day forecast data from the API** for short-term activity suitability decisions.

For medium-range predictions, we use a **multi-output regression model (Random Forest Regressor)** to predict all target variables simultaneously.

This approach allows us to:
- maintain a clean and unified forecasting pipeline  
- capture relationships between multiple weather variables  
- generate consistent inputs for downstream activity suitability decisions
