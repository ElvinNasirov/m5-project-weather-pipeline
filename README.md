# Project 1: Weather Intelligence Pipeline — Can We Trust This Data?

## Overview

Over the next two weeks you will build a complete, end-to-end **weather intelligence pipeline**. You will ingest historical and real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API, store it in a local DuckDB analytical database, perform rigorous statistical analysis, and build a predictive model — all while critically evaluating whether the data can be trusted.

**Why weather?** Weather data is publicly available, refreshed daily, has genuine quality challenges (sensor gaps, interpolation artefacts, seasonal non-stationarity), and is the backbone of decisions in energy, agriculture, logistics, and insurance. It is the perfect playground for asking *"Can we trust this data?"*

## 🌍 Tourism Weather Risk & Activity Suitability Platform

### 📌 Project Overview

This project provides data-driven weather insights to support tourism planning and decision-making. It helps travel agencies and tour operators evaluate the feasibility of outdoor activities based on both historical patterns and forecasted conditions.

The main objectives are:
- Minimize cancellation risks for tour operators  
- Enhance customer satisfaction by recommending optimal dates for specific activities  
- Provide AI-driven explanations for weather-based travel recommendations

## 🎯 Targets

We use a **multi-output regression model** to predict key weather variables required for activity suitability decisions.

- **temperature_2m_max**  
  Predicts peak daily temperature, which is critical for outdoor comfort and heat-related constraints.

- **precipitation_sum**  
  Measures total daily rainfall, the most important factor for determining whether outdoor activities are feasible.

- **wind_speed_10m_max**  
  Captures maximum wind conditions, essential for safety-sensitive activities such as cable car and boating.

- **relative_humidity_2m_mean**  
  Represents average humidity, which affects perceived temperature and overall comfort.

- **cloud_cover_mean**  
  Indicates sky conditions and visibility, useful for assessing atmosphere (e.g., sunny vs gloomy) and fog likelihood.

## 🧠 Features

### Core & Derived Weather Features

- **apparent_temperature_max**

---

### Calendar Features

- **month**

## ⚙️ Model Approach

We use historical data for model training and evaluation, applying a time-based split to ensure realistic performance assessment.

Additionally, we integrate **7-day forecast data from the API** for short-term activity suitability decisions.

For medium-range predictions, we use a **multi-output regression model (Random Forest Regressor)** to predict all target variables simultaneously.

This approach allows us to:
- maintain a clean and unified forecasting pipeline  
- capture relationships between multiple weather variables  
- generate consistent inputs for downstream activity suitability decisions
